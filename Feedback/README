This Feedback folder contain feedback generated by our EXPERIMENTAL toolset.

FEEDBACK CONTAINED IN THIS FOLDER IS ONLY EXPERIMENTAL AND IS NOT RELATED TO THE GRADING OF YOUR MP.

After each svn commit, a new folder with your commited version as name is created.

The *.test file in the folder contain information about your program.

EMPTY FOLDER MEANS NO FEEDBACK GENERATED, IT DOES NOT MEAN YOUR CODE PASSED OR FAILED ANY GRADING TEST CASE

The *.test may be generated EVEN IF YOUR CODE IS CORRECT. Our tool is still in experimentation stage so there might be errors. You are welcomed to ask questions on Piazza.

There might be a file called gdbsuspiciousInstList.txt inside you feedback folder.

Each line inside the file is a break command in gdb. The command stops execution in gdb at a specified location. For more information about gdb please search the course wiki / google.

The locations in gdbsuspiciousInstList.txt are listed in order. The top most is the most likely place where error happened. 

To make use of these commands, suggestion is to choose the top 5-10 break commands and use them in gdb to help yourself debug your code.

For more questions please use Piazza or Office hours.
